# Contributing Guidelines

- The repository must be created from you or you need to be a top-contributor to this repository.
- The items on the list should be ordered in alphabetical order
- The format should look like following:  
   `- [my-repo](https://github.com/myUsername/my-repo) - Just here for showing an example.`
- The description must be concise, short, non-promotional and gramatically correct 

### Quality standarts

- code should be functional *(ofc)* and as documented and expected
- stable or progressing toward stable
- documentated *(wiki, concise readme, in-code-documentation, ...)*
- tests, ci, coverage and so on are appreciated

At last, every request must be reviewed by an admin member of our Discord guild before it will be merged.
